# Best Neighborhood in Pittsburgh

## Group Name: People Who Show Up

Canvas Group Number: 10

Our main metric we will measure the best neighborhood by is **Happiness**. To do this, we have three submetrics that are **Community Center Attendence**, **Arrest Rates**, and **Fire Rates**.

The datasets used are: 

- [Daily Community Center Attendence](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/daily-community-center-attendance) (Community Center Attendence)
  - A dataset containing the number of attendees for every community center in Pittsburgh each day from March 2011 to March 2025.
- [Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data/resource/e03a89dd-134a-4ee8-a2bd-62c40aeebc6f) (Arrest Rates)
  - A dataset containing the people taken in custody by City of Pittsburgh's police officers. It includes information reported by the City of Pittsburgh Police.
- [Fire Incidents in City of Pittsburgh](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/fire-incidents-in-city-of-pittsburgh) (Fire Rates)
  - A dataset containing fire incidents and where they happened, responded to by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire.
